# Server - auth

The OAuth server  enables a third-party app to obtain limited access to an HTTP service. 
Instead of using the resource owner's credentials to access a protected resource, 
the client obtains an access token issued by this authorization server. 

We are issuing a token of JWT (JSON Web Token) format  that defines a compact and 
self-contained way for securely transmitting information between parties as a JSON object.
